# aws-cli-mfa
Python + bash script to streamline official AWS process for using MFA with the AWS CLI

Matches to: https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/authenticate-mfa-cli/

## Usage
Note that you MUST `source` (or its synonym `.`) to change env vars in your current shell:

    . aws-cli-mfa $AWS_MFA_ARN 123456
    . aws-cli-mfa $AWS_MFA_ARN 123456 -p rogusdev -d 57600

You must have python 3 (as `python3`) and the aws cli (as `aws`) available on your PATH in your shell.

You will pass, at a minimum, your AWS MFA ARN and the current MFA auth token from your 2fa/mfa authenticator app/device. This does not work with yubikeys/etc (per AWS docs). There are additional optional args to change the effects this script has on your system.

I recommend you have your AWS_MFA_ARN in your `.bash_profile` or as appropriate for your shell:

    echo 'export AWS_MFA_ARN=arn:aws:iam::NUMBER:mfa/USERNAME' >> $HOME/.bash_profile

Replacing the number and username as appropriate. Your MFA ARN is on this page:\
https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/security_credentials

To see all the options, run the script with `-h`:

    aws-cli-mfa -h

## Installation
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rogusdev/aws-cli-mfa/master/aws-cli-mfa && \
      sudo mv aws-cli-mfa /usr/local/bin/ && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/aws-cli-mfa
      
      for macOS, you also need to do
      
    brew install jq wget

## Building from src
Clone the repo and create the final `aws-cli-mfa` script like so:

    sed -e "/INSERT_PYTHON_CODE_HERE/r ./src/aws_cli_mfa.py" -e "s///" ./aws-cli-mfa.bash | \
      sudo tee /usr/local/bin/aws-cli-mfa > /dev/null && \
      sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/aws-cli-mfa && \
      cp /usr/local/bin/aws-cli-mfa ./

## Testing
    python3 -m unittest tests.aws_cli_mfa_tests
